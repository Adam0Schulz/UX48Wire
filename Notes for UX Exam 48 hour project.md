# Assignment
## Case: Cphbusiness Cantine Experience
The case for this assignment is the school canteen at Cphbusiness. Students and staff have expressed frustration with the current canteen experience—ranging from long lines, unclear daily menus, lack of digital ordering options, and food waste. Your task is to design a prototype for a digital solution that improves the overall user experience in the canteen. 

This could be an app or web-based system that provides features such as viewing menus, pre ordering food, personalized meal preferences, allergy filters, real-time queue monitoring, sustainability tracking, or feedback options. You define the concept—but ensure it solves real user needs. 

Your design must follow the principles and best practices presented during the course, including those outlined in the UX slides compendium and course literature list.

## Requirements 
Use a structured UX process to design your prototype. As a minimum, your process must address the following:

1. Methodology / Framework 
	- Choose and apply a design method such as Double Diamond to structure your process.
	
2. Research & Personas
	- You will be provided with two personas representing typical users of the canteen.
	- Create an empathy map for each persona to visualize what users say, think, feel, and do.
	- Conduct additional research as needed (e.g., user interviews, desk research, observations). 
	
3. Sustainable UX Canvas
	- Use the Sustainable UX Canvas to reflect on how your design addresses:
		- Environmental impact (e.g., reducing food waste, encouraging plant-based choices, digital receipts).
		- Social sustainability (e.g., inclusive menu design, allergy support, fair pricing).
		- Behavioral nudging (e.g., reminders to pre-order, default vegetarian option).
		
4. User Flows & IA
	- Create user flows, wireframes, wireflows, and user stories.
	- Include edge cases such as unavailable meals, payment errors, or sold-out items.
	- Address errors like:
		- Menu not found or unavailable.
		- Payment failure.
		- Allergy conflicts with selected items.
		
5. Accessibility & Ethics 
	- Follow WCAG principles.
	- Design for all users including dietary, cultural, and physical accessibility.
	- Avoid manipulative upselling or confusing subscriptions. 
	
6. Visual / Graphic Design 
	- Focus on energy-efficient UI: system fonts, dark mode, image optimization.
	- Prioritize intuitive layout and visual hierarchy. 
	
7. Avoid Dark Patterns
	- Ensure the design is persuasive but fair. 
	- Clearly present prices, allergens, and dietary options. 
	
8. Data & Performance
	- Include options for ethical data collection (e.g., feedback, meal preference). 
	- Use tools like EcoGrader or Website Carbon to validate environmental performance.


## Product
- Your final product is a clickable prototype in Figma or coded in HTML/CSS/JS.
- It must demonstrate how your concept improves the canteen experience and reflect sustainable design.
## Oral Exam
- 20 min group presentation (your process, insights, UX methods, and prototype demo).
- 30 min group discussion and individual questions.
- 10 min grading. (Individual grades based on the 7-point scale).
## Remember:
- Structure your documentation using UX methods from the course.
- Support your decisions using the literature list and the UX compendium.
- Sustainability and inclusion must be central to your design choices.

Pains:		
• The	canteen	menu	is	not	available	in	advance	or	lacks	detail.	
• Sustainable	packaging	options	are	not	clearly	supported	or	incentivized.	
• She	often	experiences	frustration	with	unclear	portion	sizes	and	lack	of	allergen	filtering.	
User	Stories:	
• As	a	student,	I	want	to	see	the	vegetarian	and	vegan	options	first,	so	I	can	make	an	eco-friendly	choice	
easily.	
• As	a	sustainability	advocate,	I	want	to	know	which	meals	are	produced	with	local	or	organic	
ingredients.	
• As	a	climate-conscious	user,	I	want	to	get	a	CO₂	label	per	meal,	so	I	can	compare	footprint.	
• As	a	student,	I	want	to	pre-order	lunch	in	reusable	packaging,	so	I	reduce	single-use	waste.	
• As	a	student,	I	want	to	send	suggestions	or	feedback	if	I	see	unnecessary	waste	or	packaging.

# My Notes

## braindump
- double diamond - research, insight, ideation, prototype
- assumptions are the root of all fuckups
- research data - primary and secondary  (one's you collect your self and already collected by others respectively)
- data - quantitative and qualitative
- **Idea - go to the canteen and observe ( but i think it's too late in the semester for that and the problems in this assignment don't neccessarily need to be the same as in the assignment)**
- but a field study (to go to observe the canteen would be nice)
- empathy map and user journey map
- **feature ideas based on persona:**
	- I guess it's gonna be a mobile app because students have their phone on them at all times
	- food waste, CO2 counter (overall for the day or month)
	- co2 per every meal
	- have a weekly detailed menu in the app
	- in the menu there should be all the ingredients of every meal and ideally a badge on meats for example if they're ethically sourced, with organic ingredients or locally sourced or imported
	- this might be bullshit: include something in the app that the users should bring their own lunch boxes if they want to take lunch with them and that the plastic/paper boxes are there just in the case of "emergency" - this solves or helps one of the pains of the persona
	- instead maybe this: inform the users about the fact that the packaging (if they choose to take their lunch with them and not just have it on a plate) is reusable
	- implement an AI camera above the scales that will measure how much of everything the users has on their plate
	- with the AI camera since it can detect the amount of everything on your plate it could tell you if you are perhaps buying more than usual to inform you about that so you don't create unnecessary food waste
	- have a profile of the user saved. that enables us to track what the user has eaten and have a history and save allergens so that it will show on the menu that this is not for them (there is no possibility of overlooking something for the user) 
	- have allergens listed on the menu and have the app automatically tell you if you can or can't eat certain things because of the saved allergens
	- see the vegetarian and vegan options first ( to sort of promote those over meat) - this could be considered a dark pattern so I would say to have the information about the user saved whether they are a vegetarian or vegan or a meat eater and then suggest the saved preference first.
	- have a suggestions form somewhere in the app for unnecessary waste or packaging


## **Empathy map**
### 🗣️ **SAYS**
(What she might say out loud)

- _"Ugh, I wish they’d just post the menu ahead of time—I never know what to expect."_
- _"Do you think this one’s actually vegan? It’s never clear."_
- _"I brought my container again, but they still gave me one of those plastic trays..."_
- _"It’d be so cool if we could see how much CO₂ each meal has or something."_
- _"Honestly, I just wanna eat lunch without stressing about the ingredients or waste."_
- _"Why don’t they highlight the plant-based stuff more? It’s always hidden at the bottom."_
- _"I wish I could just pre-order and skip the line—and know I’m picking something sustainable."_
#### 💭 **THINKS**
(What she thinks but may not say)

- “Am I really making a sustainable choice with this meal?”
- “I don’t trust that the food here aligns with my values.”
- “I wish the system encouraged others to be more eco-conscious too.”
- “Why aren’t allergens and ingredients clearly listed? It’s 2025.”
- “Planning my day would be easier if I could pre-order.”

#### 🧍 **DOES**
(What she physically does – her behavior)

- Brings reusable containers to school.
- Checks the canteen last minute hoping there’s a suitable meal.
- Participates in the student sustainability committee.
- Avoids buying food some days because the menu is too vague.
- Uses social media or forums to discuss sustainability and share tips.
- Writes or shares feedback when she sees food waste or bad packaging practices.

#### ❤️ **FEELS**
(What she feels emotionally – and how that appears)

- **Frustrated** – by lack of planning and transparency.
- **Empowered but overwhelmed** – she wants to make a difference, but the system doesn’t support her.
- **Hopeful** – that digital tools could improve things.
- **Excluded** – when vegan options are hidden or inconsistent.
- **Anxious** – about unknowingly contributing to waste or climate impact.


## **Problem Statement**

Signe, a climate-conscious communication student, struggles to make informed and sustainable food choices at the Cphbusiness canteen due to a lack of transparency, predictability, and digital support. She needs a mobile solution that helps her plan meals, understand their environmental impact, and reduce waste—without compromising convenience or her values.


## 🌱 **User Journey Map – Signe’s Current Canteen Experience (No App)**


---

### Persona: Signe

Signe wants to make sustainable food choices that align with her values, but the unpredictable canteen experience often leaves her frustrated, uncertain, and compromising on what matters most to her.

---
### 🎯 **Expectation**

Signe expects to easily find vegan and sustainable meal options that align with her values and allow her to reduce waste — ideally by planning in advance and bringing her own container.

---

### 🟦 **BEFORE**

#### **1.1 – Wonders what’s for lunch**

“No idea what’s on the menu today...”  
😐 Emotion level: **Neutral**

#### **1.2 – Checks poster or asks friends**

“Why is it never posted anywhere in advance?”  
😠 Emotion level: **Frustrated**

#### **1.3 – Packs her reusable container anyway**

“I hope I can actually use this today.”  
🙂 Emotion level: **Slightly hopeful**

---

### 🟩 **DURING**

#### **2.1 – Arrives, waits in line**

_Sees crowd, still unsure what food is available_  
😐 Emotion level: **Neutral**

#### **2.2 – Looks at menu or buffet**

“What’s even in this dish? Is it vegan?”  
😕 Emotion level: **Worried/uncertain**

#### **2.3 – Asks staff or guesses ingredients**

“I guess I’ll take this... I’m not sure though.”  
😞 Emotion level: **Low/frustrated**

#### **2.4 – Pays with no info about CO₂ or sustainability**

_Leaves with tray or container, no sustainability indicators_  
😐 Emotion level: **Neutral**

---

### 🟨 **AFTER**

#### **3.1 – Eats but questions her choice**

“Was that really vegan? Was it local?”  
🙂 Emotion level: **Mild satisfaction, but unsure**

#### **3.2 – Notices unnecessary packaging**

“They still used a tray even though I brought my box...”  
😐 Emotion level: **Flat/neutral again**

#### **3.3 – Wants to give feedback but doesn’t know how**

“I wish there was a way to tell them about this.”  
😞 Emotion level: **Low again**

---

### 🎢 **Emotion Curve Description**

- **Starts neutral** (1.1)
- **Dips** with lack of menu (1.2)
- **Slight rise** from bringing container (1.3)
- **Neutral** during queue (2.1)
- **Dips again** at menu confusion (2.2–2.3)
- **Neutral** at checkout (2.4)
- **Small rise** post-meal (3.1)
- **Drops again** when noticing waste and no feedback channel (3.2–3.3)

🟰 Emotion shape = like a **shallow “W”**, with **two key dips** (before and during meal decision), and **mild rises** around personal effort (container) and post-meal relief.

---

### 💡 **Opportunities**

- Provide a weekly menu with ingredient and allergen info
- Highlight vegan, organic, and local options clearly
- Show CO₂ footprint and sustainability badges for meals
- Support and promote reusable packaging behavior
- Offer easy ways to give feedback and suggest improvements
- Let users set dietary preferences and see tailored meal highlights



## **User Interview (via a Questionnaire)**

- obviously would be better in person face-to-face but due to lack of time I decided to questionnaire rather then nothing
- 

## **Desk research**

### KU Canteen
- wicked Rabbit / Folkekokken / Food & Co.
- for KU for every campus it's different 
- for nbb there is a vegetarian option always and sometimes there is both vegetarian and carnivore but not vegan
- the information could only be found on the internal net and it's different for every campus (sometimes it's a pdf that used to work but not anymore and sometimes it's directly on the internal net)
- the information about ingredients is minimal - just a list of the main ones (not all of them) 
- no locally sourced / organic / ethically sourced badges
- how ever KU doesn't serve beef (due to environmental issues)
- the parent company food & co has an application but I as an employee of the KU couldn't log in

- to some degree nevermind because I found the eat@KU app where you can see the weekly menu with again some of the ingredients but nothing about it's source or if it's organic or anything they do have one canteen for vegetarian and one for carnivores
- for allergens they just say to contact the kitchen staff
- you can scan items with your camera and pay for them in the app but i think it's only for drinks and packaged stuff like not the main meal because that is a buffet
- they do say that the menu world wide but based on danish ingredients in season
- there is a way of providing feed back and it's easy to find but I think it's a little hard to actualy file it (it's with this findsmiley.dk) -> now I've learned that that is an official danish government website for health inspection. So you could complain but not to the canteen but to the authorities or just see the reports
- white theme
- and at least they have opening hours there
- **found some reviews for eat@DTU which should be done by the same company and essentially the same app:**
	- ![[Pasted image 20250616151540.png]]

	- ![[Pasted image 20250616152051.png]]



## **Prioritization matrix**
### Brainstorming features
- Display weekly menu
- display prices (clearly with a product image)
- display opening hours
- display canteen busy status
- display a detailed description of foods on the menu (ingredients / organic or not / local or not / CO2 per meal)
- Overall CO2 counter
- inform users that they should use plates and eat in the canteen or if it's not possible then the take out packaging is recyclable but inform that if they know that they are gonna take take out in advance they should bring their own reusable boxes
- include portion selection when pre-ordering and just show the available portions on the menu
- have a user profile (for saving allergens and saving payment methods pre-ordering)
- have the menu display allergens as well with every meal (in case of no allergens tell that to the user explicitly cause it could be confusing if there is nothing)
- slightly favor displaying vegetarian and vegan meals on the menu to promote sustainability
- have a suggestions form somewhere in the app


### 📊 **Prioritization Matrix: Impact vs. Effort**

#### 🟩 **High Impact / Low Effort** (DO FIRST — MVP Features)

These are **must-haves** — valuable and feasible to implement in a prototype.

- 🟢 Display weekly menu
- 🟢 Meal details: ingredients, allergens, labels (organic/local/CO₂)
- 🟢 Pre-order meals (basic flow)
- 🟢 Choose portion size
- 🟢 Display prices clearly
- 🟢 User profile with saved allergens
- 🟢 Encourage reusable containers with a reminder message
- 🟢 Suggestion form
- 🟢 Display opening hours
- 🟢 Packaging choice during pre-order

---

#### 🟨 **High Impact / High Effort** (PLAN — Add if time allows)

Valuable for Signe and the system, but more complex technically or structurally.

- 🟡 In-app payment system
- 🟡 User profile with dietary preference filtering (vegan/vegetarian)
- 🟡 Sort menu based on dietary preference
- 🟡 Canteen busy status indicator
- 🟡 Feedback/rating system for meals
- 🟡 CO₂ footprint tracker over time
- 🟡 Packaging choice during pre-order
- 🟡 Order history

---

#### 🟦 **Low Impact / Low Effort** (BONUS — Nice but not essential)

Not critical to core user problem but still easy to implement.

- 🔵“No allergens” explicitly shown
- 🔵 Small sustainability nudges or tips
- 🔵 Display a small badge for vegan/vegetarian (if already filtered)
- 🔵 Visual polish like a “meal of the day” highlight

---

#### 🟥 **Low Impact / High Effort** (DEFER — Not a priority now)

Less relevant to user goals or too complex for your project timeframe.

- 🔴 Findsmiley.dk integration (external, better handled via link if needed)
- 🔴 Real-time crowd tracking (requires hardware or integrations)
- 🔴 Full impact tracker (accurate CO₂ reduction per user, backend-intensive)



## **UX sustainability canvas**
### 🌱 **Environmental Sustainability – Reducing CO₂ Impact**

#### 🔍 Visible Design

- **Dark mode option** to reduce battery use on OLED devices.
- **Minimalist UI** to reduce data load and speed up interactions.
- **Meal CO₂ footprint display** per item to promote informed, climate-conscious choices.
- **Low-resolution images & system fonts** (e.g., WebP/SVG) to reduce bandwidth.
- **No unnecessary animations or videos** that drain power or data.

#### ⚙️ Invisible Design

- **Lazy loading**: Images and data only load when needed (e.g., menus, past orders).
- **Code optimization**: Minified assets for faster performance and lower energy use.
- **Green hosting**: Hosted on servers powered by renewable energy (e.g., GreenWeb).
- **Caching and local storage** for frequent menu data and user preferences.
- **Fewer API calls** via bundling and smart data use → less server energy usage.

---

### 🤝 **Social Sustainability – Inclusive, Fair, Accessible**

#### ♿ Accessibility

- **WCAG-compliant** design: high contrast, alt text, resizable text.
- **Thumb-friendly mobile layout** for one-handed navigation.
- **Screen reader compatibility** through semantic HTML and ARIA roles.

#### 🌍 Inclusion

- **Language selector**: Easy switching for international students.
- **Plain language** in UI to support all reading levels.
- **Offline access** to pre-saved menus if connection drops in the building.

#### ⚖️ Equity

- **Transparent pricing** on all meals — no surprises or unclear upsells.
- **No feature-gating**: All users can access CO₂ info and provide feedback regardless of profile status.

---

### 🧭 **Governance – Sustainability in Design & Process**

#### 🧠 Ethics

- **No dark patterns** — all actions are clear, undoable, and not manipulative.
- **Transparent data use** — explain why allergens, preferences, and dietary settings are saved.
- **Privacy-first** — only store necessary info (e.g., dietary needs for filtering, not full profiles).

#### 🛠 Processes

- Sustainability considered from the **beginning of the design process**, not added later.
- **Design decisions logged** (e.g., why we favor reusable containers or show CO₂ info).
- Environmental performance can be validated via tools like **EcoGrader**.

#### 🧩 Strategic Anchoring (specific to canteen app)

- All students feel welcome — regardless of diet, culture, or accessibility needs.
- The app promotes **climate-positive behavior**, but lets users choose:
    - Reusable container option
    - Meal impact data
- Feedback system lets users **report food waste or packaging issues**, encouraging system-wide improvements.
